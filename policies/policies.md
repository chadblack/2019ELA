![](http://chadblack.net/511S2012/media/images/disability.png) Qualified
students with disabilities needing appropriate academic adjustments should
contact me as soon as possible to ensure that your needs are met in a timely
manner with appropriate documentation.

**Attendance:** Attendance at all class sessions is mandatory. If you will not be able to attend
class, please contact me ahead of time.

**Deadlines:** Assignments must be turned to the instructor no later than the
end of class on the day they are due, or at some other specified time
established by the professor. Late papers will not be accepted
without prior arrangement. This includes technology problems.

**Cell Phones and Laptops:** Please silence and put away your cell phones prior to class.
Please do not text during class. Cell phones are not permitted in class, and
need to be put away for the duration of our meetings. Laptops are allowed only for tasks
related to this class. Distracting use of technology (social media,
surfing, etc.) causes problems not only for your own learning, but for
those around you. Research shows that analog notetaking improves learning.
Consider having paper with you. Based on the prevailing
literature, hand note-taking-- both while reading and in class-- leads to
substantially better educational outcomes. You are not required to have a laptop
in class, so feel free to leave it at home. If, however, you have reason to use
your laptop for notetaking, I won't stop you from doing so.

**Drop-In Hours**: Students are strongly encouraged to speak with me outside of
class. The advantages of talking with me include: extra help on an assignment
or preparation for an exam; clarification of materials covered in lecture,
discussion of my comments on your work; discussion of this or related courses.

Drop-In hours are my time set aside specifically for you. It's very hard to get
to know students and professors in large classes like this. So, I set aside
hours every week where we can talk one-on-one or in a small group to talk about
any topic related to your studies, including questions about coursework, study
skills, your experiences here at UTK, the future, the past, my areas of
research, and more!

If you cannot come by during office hours, please contact me via email or phone and I
will be happy to set up an appointment with you.

**Changes:** I reserve the write to change this syllabus as the semester
progresses. This is not a contract, but rather a document to guide expectations
and clearly communicate weekly assignments. Please bring the syllabus with you
to our class meetings. Or, keep up with it on the course website.
