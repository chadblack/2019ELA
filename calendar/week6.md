# week 6: who conquered whom?

In the 1520s and 1530s, the Spanish Empire expanded to cover much of Central
and South America. At the time, Spaniards and their native allies both imagined
themselves as conquering the controlling empires of Mesoamerica and the Andes.
Who, then, conquered whom? In the early 16th century, did native allies with
the Spanish imagine themselves as collaborators in European domination? If not,
what did they imagine they were doing?

* Matthew Restall, et. al., Mesoamerican Voices: Native-Language Writings from Colonial Mexico, Oaxaca, Yucatan, and Guatemala (Cambridge: 2005): Chapter 3.

* “The Spaniards’ Entry into Tenochtitlan,” The Mexico Reader, 97-104.

* For a fantastic graphic novel approach to telling this story, check out
  the five episodes so far written and drawn at [Aztec
  Empire](https://www.bigredhair.com/books/aztec-empire/about/). This
  graphic novel version of the Conquest works hard to be faithful to the
  visual world and recent historical scholarship on Cortes's march from
  the sea.
