# week 3: early america two

The collapse of Classical Maya society did not mean the disappearance of the
Maya. Indeed, Maya-speaking communities continue to form integral parts of
Mexican and Guatemalan society today, along with other Central American states.
This week, we consider the successors and inheritors of the mesoamerican
cultural world once dominated by the Maya, with the rise of the Mexica in the
central valley of Mexico. Then, we turn to South America for an introduction to
the third great sedentary empire of the pre-Conquest period, the Inka of the
Andes. As you read and attend lecture this week, consider the influence of
environmental factors on the emergence of these civilizations along with their
religious and social practices.
