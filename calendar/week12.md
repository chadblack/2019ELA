# week 12: love and hate

This week, we are focusing on family, sexuality, and social order. The customs
and laws of Iberia and the Indies were deeply influential in the ordering (and
disordering) of colonial society. The Conquest, and its aftermath, included
exploitative and coercive relationships, and even regular marriages had their
fair share of conflict between spouses. This week, we consider these things by
looking at unnatural sexuality and witchcraft, as a way of also understanding
what colonial society understood to be natural.
