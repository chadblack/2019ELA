# week 13 -- disruption, reform

This week, we look at the early transformations of the colonial relationship
after the Spanish War for succession. We'll do this through readings and film,
with the recently released Zama (2018). Consider the reforms posited by José
Galvez, and reactions to them that fall short of open rebellion.
