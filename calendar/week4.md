# week 4: across the atlantic

With a foundation in the pre-Conquest Americas, this week we turn to the
Iberian Peninsula, the close-in Atlantic islands, and to Africa to look at the
roots of conquest in the so-called "Old World." Consider the culture of
conquest cultivated by Isabella and Ferdinand in the 1490s, and also what
lessons Iberians learned of conquest and expansion in their control of Atlantic
Islands and the trade in enslaved captives with West Africa.
