# week 8: la otra conquista

Our first film of the semester. *La otra conquista* (The Other Conquest) tells
the story of a Mexica scribe who struggles with the transformation of Tonantzin
into La Virgen. As you watch the film, pay close attention to how its narration
performs double mistaken identity^[James Lockhart defines Double Mistaken
Identity as a process, "in which each side of a cultural exchange presumes
that a given form or concept is functioning in teh way familiar within its
own tradition and is unaware of or unimpressed by the other's side's
inerpretation." *Of Things of the Indies* (Standford University Press,
1999): 99.], and also the nature of the differing
cataclysms of the period.
