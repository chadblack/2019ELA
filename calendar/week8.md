# week 8: la otra conquista

Our first film of the semester. *La otra conquista* (The Other Conquest) tells
the story of a Mexica scribe who struggles with the transformation of Tonantzin
into La Virgen. As you watch the film, pay close attention to how its narration
performs double mistaken identity, and also the nature of the differing
cataclysms of the period.

October 8 (Tuesday)

* Martin Nesvig, *Promiscuous Power*, "Burnign Down the House, in Which the
  spiritual Conquistadors Go to War with Each Other."
