# week 10: captivity, enslavement, freedom

From its inception, the Spanish and Portuguese colonial projects depended on
the labor of enslaved Africans. As Kris Lane argues, slave owners even pinned
their hopes for the afterlife on enslaved labor after death. Pay close
attention this week to strategies that enslaved and free blacks pursued in
colonial Latin America.
