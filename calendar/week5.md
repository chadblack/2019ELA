# week 5: the early encounter

Prior to sailing across the Atlantic, Columbus learned from Portuguese and
Spanish expansion into the Atlantic Islands and down the coast of Africa
economic models for colonial exploitation. Conquering and enslaving native
populations, importing captive Africans for enslaved labor, cultivating sugar
for export to Europe, and improving sea-going technology were all in place
before he received Royal support. This week, we look at the transplantation of
an Atlantic model of conquest and exploitation to the Caribbean, and at its
religious critics. Pay close attention to the arguments made by Friars
Montesinos, Pane, and de las Casas, and whether they offer an alternative
colonial model, or an alternative to colonialism?
