# week 11: native labor and the world

Enslavement was not the only form of coerced labor exploited by Iberian
empires. This week we consider the effects of encomienda and tribute on the
integrity of native communities under Iberian rule. What significance is there
in native communities pursuing their own legal strategies before the crown? How
did tribute taxation and labor function? Were the New Laws successful?
